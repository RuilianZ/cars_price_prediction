```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

theme_set(theme_minimal() + theme(legend.position = "bottom"))
```

```{r}
# data import and cleaning
car = read_csv("data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(- c(x1, new_price)) %>% 
  drop_na(power) %>% 
  filter(power != "null bhp") %>% 
  mutate(price = price * 1309.57)

# check for NA
colSums(is.na(car))
```

For the response variable `price`, the original data used 100000 Indian Rupee as unit. For better illustration, we transformed it to USD, using the exchange rate of 100000 Indian Rupee equals to 1309.75 USD on March 21, 2022.
